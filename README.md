# AnimeMgr
Anime list manager script

You can manually enter and manage the data of the application or you can also add an api client ID with the command

`./animemgr --setopt apikey={your key here}`

With the api key set, you will be able to use the `-m` or `--myanimelist` option to search/parse anime data from the MyAnimeList.net api.
